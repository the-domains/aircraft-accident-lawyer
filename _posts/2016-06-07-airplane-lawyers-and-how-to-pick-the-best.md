# Airplane Lawyers - And How to Pick the Best

You've seen the ads: someone is in a car accident or has breathing issues, and there's a lawyer advertising his personal injury services or how they can possibly help you score a big claim in a mesothelioma case.

It's big business and may seem unethical. But is it?

The bottom line is that everyone is "lawyering up" these days so if you're not represented by a solid legal team, then you might end up the victim... even if you feel you are in the right.
